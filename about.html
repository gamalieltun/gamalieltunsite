          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in Myanmar, where my early interest in technology began with curiosity about how devices, apps, and systems work. After moving to Singapore to pursue my Diploma in Computer Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic, I discovered a strong passion for both software and hardware—especially cloud systems, automation, and microcontroller projects. Each stage of my education has pushed me to explore new technologies and sharpen my problem-solving mindset.
          </p>
          <h3>What I'm Doing</h3>
          <p>
            Today, I’m interning at Infineon Technologies Singapore as a Reliability Product Testing Engineer. My work involves supporting product testing, analyzing reliability data, and ensuring semiconductor devices meet strict quality and performance standards. Outside of my internship, I actively build personal and school projects ranging from Raspberry Pi systems and STM32 microcontroller applications to full-stack web tools and cloud-based solutions.
          </p>
          <h3>What I care about</h3>
          <p>
            I care about building technology that is reliable, accessible, and impactful. I believe engineering is not just about creating systems—it’s about solving real problems and improving lives. Whether through cloud infrastructure, embedded systems, or long-term work in the semiconductor industry, my goal is to continue learning, innovating, and contributing to meaningful technological progress.
