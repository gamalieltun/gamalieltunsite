        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p>
          SafeStride was created as a school project in the elective module <strong>“Technology to Business (T2B)”</strong>. 
          The module required students to identify a real-world problem, develop a technical solution, 
          validate the idea with users, and build a business model around it. Our team focused on mobility challenges 
          faced by the visually impaired community in Singapore.

        <p>
          SafeStride is a detachable smart cane add-on designed to help visually impaired individuals detect 
          obstacles above knee level—something traditional canes often cannot detect. The device uses an ultrasonic 
          sensor to measure distance and alerts the user with buzzer feedback that increases in frequency as obstacles get closer.
        </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Detects elevated obstacles such as open windows, railings, tables, and platforms.</li>
          <li>Up to <strong>3 meters</strong> detection range with directional sensing.</li>

          HabiTrack is a youth-focused habit and fitness tracking app developed during the 
          <strong>Social Innovation Project (SIP)</strong> module in Year 2 at Singapore Polytechnic. 
          Our challenge was to propose a realistic solution that encourages healthier lifestyles 
          among youths aged 17–25 in Queenstown, based on real user research and problem validation.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Insights from the SIP survey and interviews showed a clear pattern: 
          <strong>youths want to stay active, but struggle due to tight schedules, inconsistent motivation, and lack of structure</strong>. 
          HabiTrack addresses this by combining simple everyday routines with gamification, progress tracking, 
          and friendly competition.

          <li><strong>Supported concept clustering</strong> from the initial 15 raw idea directions to the final app concept.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
        <h4>Core Problem We Addressed</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Youths lack <strong>structured motivation</strong> to maintain healthy habits.</li>
          <li><strong>Time constraints</strong> and long commuting routes reduce exercise consistency.</li>
          <li>Most apps focus on advanced fitness goals, not small, achievable weekly habits.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Key App Features (Based on Real User Input)</h4>
        <p>
          Each feature was selected because it directly supports the users’ motivations identified in the SIP findings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gamified streaks & points</strong> – keeps engagement high without overwhelming users.</li>
          <li><strong>Weekly goal-setting</strong> – encourages realistic, achievable health habits.</li>
          <li><strong>Leaderboard</strong> – competitive motivation for users who enjoy comparing progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Location-based activity suggestions</strong> – nearby places like parks, tracks, and gyms.</li>
          <li><strong>Simple task-based routines</strong> – avoids complex fitness plans.</li>

        <h4>User Research & Validation</h4>
        <p>
          Using the User Journey Map and gallery walk insights, we identified exactly what motivates 
          and discourages youths. Below are the key findings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users preferred <strong>short, manageable activity goals</strong> over long workouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Gamification</strong> was consistently rated as the most engaging element.</li>
          <li>Clear visual progress and streaks helped maintain commitment.</li>
          <li>Users requested <strong>reminders</strong> and <strong>simple UI navigation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Outcome</h4>

        <p>
          UniCycle is a multi-functional mobile app created for <strong>Singapore Polytechnic students</strong> as part of a 
          team project. Its main purpose is to provide a <strongcampus-specific marketplace</strong> where students can buy, 
          sell, or donate used academic materials while also connecting with seniors for study help and project advice. 
          The idea directly addresses the problem statement described in the project proposal: 
          <em>“How can we create a platform that supports recycling of academic materials and meaningful knowledge-sharing?”</em>
          :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
        </p>
    
        <p>
          According to the background research in our proposal, Singapore’s domestic recycling rate has fallen 
          from 62% to 52% in recent years, partly due to the drop in recycled paper and textbooks. 
          UniCycle offers a practical solution by <strong>extending the lifespan of academic resources</strong> 
          and reducing waste on campus. (Background data on page 4) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>
    
        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Implemented the full Marketplace system</strong> including:
            <ul>
              <li>Market listings (buy, sell, donate)</li>
              <li>Category filtering</li>
              <li>Search bar and item browsing (pages 26–29)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Integrated camera features</strong> to allow users to capture item photos and upload them when posting items
              (donation and sale posting screens on pages 27–28). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>
          <li><strong>Developed the posting interface</strong> (form, categories, price, description).</li>
          <li><strong>Coded in-app messaging</strong> to enable students to communicate with buyers and sellers.</li>
          <li>Contributed to database integration using <strong>MySQL + SQLite</strong> for item storage and retrieval.</li>
        </ul>

          <img src="assets/images/project-unicycle-marketplace.jpg" alt="Marketplace Flow" />
        </div>
    
        <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
        <p>
          As this was a large-scale student project with multiple functional areas (marketplace, community forum, 
          QR features, admin filtering, notifications), we encountered several difficulties during development:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Database Synchronization</strong> – Integrating MySQL, SQLite, and WAMP server resulted in timing issues and occasional mismatched data.</li>
          <li><strong>Camera & Image Upload</strong> – Getting consistent image quality across phones required adjustments in the Camera API workflow.</li>
          <li><strong>UI Alignment</strong> – Coordinating consistent layouts across the Marketplace and Community pages was tricky because four team members handled different screens.</li>
          <li><strong>Messaging Integration</strong> – Ensuring smooth user-to-user messaging while maintaining message history required additional data structure changes.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          Despite these challenges, we were able to deliver a <strong>functional working prototype</strong> with all core features implemented. 
          Some adjustments were made to simplify the payment structure and admin moderation flows, but the 
          overall app experience remained consistent with the project vision described in the proposal.

        <h4>Key Features of UniCycle</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Marketplace</strong> – Buy, sell, donate academic materials (books, tools, stationery).</li>
          <li><strong>Camera Upload</strong> – Users can capture item photos directly from the app.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Forum</strong> – Discussion space for project help, module advice, and mentorship 
              (page 32–34). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>
          <li><strong>QR Code</strong> – Used for easy profile sharing (page 24). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications</strong> – Alerts for offers, posts, and messages.</li>
          <li><strong>User Profile & Editing</strong> – Students can track their posted items and received posts (page 23). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p>
          UniCycle stands out as an app that supports <strong>environmental sustainability</strong>, 
          <strong>student affordability</strong>, and <strongcommunity building</strong>, offering both academic material recycling 
          and mentorship features (page 14). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
          The project allowed me to apply my skills in mobile development, marketplace architecture, camera 
          integration, and messaging logic while working within a team-driven environment.
