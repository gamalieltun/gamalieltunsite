        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p>
          SafeStride was created as a school project in the elective module <strong>“Technology to Business (T2B)”</strong>. 
          The module required students to identify a real-world problem, develop a technical solution, 
          validate the idea with users, and build a business model around it. Our team focused on mobility challenges 
          faced by the visually impaired community in Singapore.

          HabiTrack is a youth-focused habit and fitness tracking app developed during the 
          <strong>Social Innovation Project (SIP)</strong> module in Year 2 at Singapore Polytechnic. 
          Our challenge was to propose a realistic solution that encourages healthier lifestyles 
          among youths aged 17–25 in Queenstown, based on real user research and problem validation.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Insights from the SIP survey and interviews showed a clear pattern: 
          <strong>youths want to stay active, but struggle due to tight schedules, inconsistent motivation, and lack of structure</strong>. 
          HabiTrack addresses this by combining simple everyday routines with gamification, progress tracking, 
          and friendly competition.

        <p>
          Using the User Journey Map and gallery walk insights, we identified exactly what motivates 
          and discourages youths. Below are the key findings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users preferred <strong>short, manageable activity goals</strong> over long workouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Gamification</strong> was consistently rated as the most engaging element.</li>
          <li>Clear visual progress and streaks helped maintain commitment.</li>
          <li>Users requested <strong>reminders</strong> and <strong>simple UI navigation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          UniCycle is a multi-functional mobile app created for <strong>Singapore Polytechnic students</strong> as part of a 
          team project. Its main purpose is to provide a <strongcampus-specific marketplace</strong> where students can buy, 
          sell, or donate used academic materials while also connecting with seniors for study help and project advice. 
          The idea directly addresses the problem statement described in the project proposal: 
          <em>“How can we create a platform that supports recycling of academic materials and meaningful knowledge-sharing?”</em>
        </p>
    
        <p>
          According to the background research in our proposal, Singapore’s domestic recycling rate has fallen 
          from 62% to 52% in recent years, partly due to the drop in recycled paper and textbooks. 
          UniCycle offers a practical solution by <strong>extending the lifespan of academic resources</strong> 
          and reducing waste on campus. (Background data on page 4) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>
    
        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Implemented the full Marketplace system</strong> including:
            <ul>
              <li>Market listings (buy, sell, donate)</li>
              <li>Category filtering</li>
              <li>Search bar and item browsing</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Integrated camera features</strong> to allow users to capture item photos and upload them when posting items.</li>
          <li><strong>Developed the posting interface</strong> (form, categories, price, description).</li>
          <li><strong>Coded in-app messaging</strong> to enable students to communicate with buyers and sellers.</li>
          <li>Contributed to database integration using <strong>Firebase</strong> for item storage and retrieval.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
        <p>
          As this was a large-scale student project with multiple functional areas (marketplace, community forum, 
          QR features, admin filtering, notifications), we encountered several difficulties during development:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Database Synchronization</strong> – Integrating Firebase resulted in timing issues and occasional mismatched data.</li>
          <li><strong>Camera & Image Upload</strong> – Getting consistent image quality across phones required adjustments in the Camera API workflow.</li>
          <li><strong>UI Alignment</strong> – Coordinating consistent layouts across the Marketplace and Community pages was tricky because four team members handled different screens.</li>
          <li><strong>Messaging Integration</strong> – Ensuring smooth user-to-user messaging while maintaining message history required additional data structure changes.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          Despite these challenges, we were able to deliver a <strong>functional working prototype</strong> with all core features implemented. 
          Some adjustments were made to simplify the payment structure and admin moderation flows, but the 
          overall app experience remained consistent with the project vision described in the proposal.

        <p>
          <strong>Carousel CarPark</strong> is a hardware-driven innovation created under the 
          <strong>Microcontroller Applications module</strong>. The project addresses a critical challenge highlighted 
          in our research: in Singapore, EV adoption is increasing rapidly, yet EV parking lots and charging 
          spaces remain limited. As referenced in our slides, there are <strong>only ~6,000 charging points</strong> today, 
          far below the national target of <strong>60,000 by 2030</strong>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The solution is a <strong>vertical automated parking carousel</strong> that stores EVs in stacked rotating 
          compartments—minimizing land use while enabling each slot to support EV charging. This system directly 
          aligns with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and SDG goals on sustainable energy and efficient cities.

          <li><strong>Real-Time Display</strong> – LCD showing slot number and carousel movement.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Complex mechanical alignment</strong> to ensure smooth rotation.</li>
          <li><strong>Chain tension & measurements</strong> needed precise adjustments before printing.</li>
          <li><strong>Weight distribution</strong> during rotation caused stability issues in early prototypes.</li>
          <li><strong>Microcontroller integration</strong> required syncing sensors with physical movement.</li>
          <li>Iterative design revisions were needed to match the concept sketches.</li>
